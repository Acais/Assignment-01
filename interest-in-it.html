<h2 style="text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h2><br>

<body bgcolor="#D6DBDF">

  <p style="text-align:center;">•	I have always been fond of IT. I am baffled on how a tiny chip can have so much power,
    how typing a bunch of words produces a program and how the possibilities are endless. My interest really started when I was little,
    my father was a photographer and I was amazed at what he could do with a camera. Since then I have been involved in film & TV as a
    hobby and I also am the go-to IT person at work (If I don’t know the answer, I can generally figure it out, basic office upkeep).<br>
    •	RMIT ranked in the top 1% of universities globally last year and as I need to study via correspondence it was an obvious
    choice for me who was wanting to study IT. <br>
    •	I expect to gain a basic understanding of many IT-related topics through this Introductory course.
    Through the entire bachelor degree, I expect to obtain all requirements to obtain employment in either cybersecurity,
    web/app/program development or networking.<br>
