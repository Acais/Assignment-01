<h4>Bio:</h4>
I am a 31-year-old separated father of an amazing 3-year-old boy named Leonardo. I do not get to see him often as he lives in Mexico with his mother which is not ideal. But thanks to IT I can see and talk with him every day, he helps me keep on top of my Spanish too.
I have lived in Mexico for around 3 years and since my separation earlier this year, it has brought me back to Australia and has made me rethink my goals in life, hence studying to do something I am passionate about.
I have previously started a Bachelor of Business with Griffith University but do not intend to finish it as my passion is in IT as opposed to what I am currently doing. Also, I am an Operations Manager for a finance company so I have the relevant experience required and do not feel finishing that degree will benefit me.
I love basketball and AFL. My favourite anime series are Cowboy Bebop, Sword Art Online, Seven Deadly Sins, Dragon Ball & Naruto. I really enjoy games, mostly RPG’s but also dabble in others like DOTA. Warhammer, Space Crusade and Magic are some of my favs, I have never played DND but am super keen to. I also don’t read a lot of books but I do enjoy comics.
